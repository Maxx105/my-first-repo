        <p>I am a Systems Application Engineer for a professional Audio, Video, and Control manufacturer called QSC. I have been working there for 2 years and hope to shift my focus within the company or industry to software development. </p>
        <p>Before working at QSC, I double majored at California State University, Fullerton and got Bachelor's degrees in both music and physics. While shifting my focus to coding and software is quite a different pursuit, there are many similarities. I look forward to learning more in this class!</p>
